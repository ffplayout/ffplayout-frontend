**The Interface is mostly made for 24/7 streaming.** Other scenarios like streaming in folder mode or playlists with no starting time will work, but is not shown correctly.

For a better understanding about the functionality, take a look to the screenshots below.


You can install it on a fresh Debian like system with the [standalone installer](https://github.com/ffplayout/ffplayout-installer).
